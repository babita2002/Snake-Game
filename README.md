I had created a Python-based-game using the following modules:

Turtle: It is a pre-installed python library that enables users to create shapes and pictures by providing them with a virtual canvas.
Time: This function is used to count the number of seconds elapsed since the epoch.
Random: This function is used to generate random numbers in Python by using random module.
